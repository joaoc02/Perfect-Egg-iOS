# Perfect-Egg-iOS
A simple iOS App to showcase some of my Swift coding skills while I'm continuously learning more.
This app is a simple timer where a user selects the hardness of the Egg to boil, then the counter starts, a progress bar is displayed at the bottom and a notification chime is played when ready.
